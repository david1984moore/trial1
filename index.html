                <p>Life's lessons <strong>require learning.</strong></em></p>
                <p> I am an aspiring web developer from Wilmington, DE. Born in 1984, in many ways, I have grown up as the internet has grown up. 
                    I had an active childhood, playing sports year-round.  Always outside, continuously absorbing my natural surroundings. In the 
                    mid 90s, my younger brother and I became obsessed with a “computer game”, EA Sports: Triple play. We played for hours at a time 
                    when it was raining outside (and many sunny days for that matter). We always managed to find the obscure hiding spots that our 
                    mother would hide the game disc in order to keep us off the computer. She was never successful. While competing against my 
                    brother was always the pinnacle of my day, I was simultaneously fascinated with the magic of tapping keys and using a monitor 
                    to derive such fun. The memory of this experience has beaten a path of well-connected synapses in my brain.</p><br>
                    <p>In 2004 I moved to Abilene, TX and I studied psychology and graphic design at Abilene Christian University. I also took a job as a waiter at Red 
                    Lobster. It was there I fell in love with having cash in my pocket every day. Enamored with the rockstar-esque culinary 
                    lifestyle, I quit school and worked in restaurants for the next 15 years. I loved making art with food. From waiter to dishwasher 
                    to cook to kitchen manager, to director of dining services for an assisted living facility, I worked in nearly every position 
                    imaginable in a restaurant. I even met a few celebrities along the way. However, as I continued in this restaurant life, this 
                    nagging desire to make a more “permanent” form of art would not wane. I grew weary of creating art that was destined for intestines.</p><br>
                    <p>In 2022, out of the food industry for the first time in a long time, I earned a realtor license in the state of Delaware and 
                    began working on designing a jot-form tool to be used in cold calls for a small real estate team in Delaware. Suddenly, I was 
                    transported back to the mid 90s and the cd-rom baseball game. I was excited to design and create something that could be used 
                    by anyone….on a computer. The epiphany was swift and I began researching the logistics of a career in web development. So in 
                    2022 I started my ultimate path to becoming a web developer with and interest in design. <em>My journey continues.</em>
